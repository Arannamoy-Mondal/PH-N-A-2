<h3>Explain the Primary Key and Foreign Key concepts in PostgreSQL.</h3>

- <h3>A Primary Key is a unique identifier for each record in a table. It ensures that each row can be uniquely identified and must contain unique, non-null values. Every table can have only one primary key. A Foreign Key is a column (or set of columns) in one table that refers to the Primary Key in another table. It is used to create a relationship between two tables. Foreign keys do not have to be unique, but they must match a valid primary key value in the referenced table.</h3>

<h3>What is the difference between the VARCHAR and CHAR data types?</h3>

- <h3>VARCHAR(n) has a flexible length, meaning the user can store up to n characters, using fewer if desired. In contrast, CHAR(n) has a fixed length, meaning it always stores exactly n characters by padding shorter strings with spaces if necessary.</h3>

<h3>Explain the purpose of the WHERE clause in a SELECT statement.</h3>

</li>
